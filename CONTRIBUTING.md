# Contributing

## Welcome

Welcome, before submitting code, you should first complete the following prerequisites:

### Create a GitHub account

Before you get started, you will need to signup for a GitHub user account.

### Code of Conduct

Please make sure to read and observe the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Using GitHub Issues

I use GitHub issues to track bugs and enhancements. If you are reporting a bug, please help to speed up problem diagnosis by providing as much information as possible. Ideally, that would include a small sample project that reproduces the problem.

## Opening a Pull Request

- Open your pull request against `main`
- Write clear and meaningful git commit messages.
- When you make a PR for small change (such as fixing a typo, style change, or grammar fix), please squash your commits so that we can maintain a cleaner git history.
- Make sure you include a clear and detailed PR description explaining the reasons for the changes, and ensuring there is sufficient information for the reviewer to understand your PR.

## Testing

- It should pass all tests in the available continuous integration systems.
- You should add/modify tests to cover your proposed code changes.
- If your pull request contains a new feature, please document it on the README.
